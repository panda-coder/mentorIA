# mentorIA

## Introduction

mentorIA is a self-study studio designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to build customized study sessions. The application interacts with AI by prompting it with questions and subjects related to the chosen theme. Additionally, mentorAI can scrape educational content from various sites like YouTube, making it a comprehensive tool for self-learning.

## Future Features

- **AI-Powered Learning**: Utilizes LLMs to generate study material based on user prompts (pre build in plugins).
- **Web Scraping**: Gathers additional resources and educational content from sites like YouTube.
- **Interactive Sessions**: Creates dynamic and engaging study sessions tailored to individual learning preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with ease of use in mind, making it accessible for all learners.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Transitioning from Flet to Kivy for improved stability and support across multiple platforms.
- **Gamification**: Incorporates elements of gamification to make learning more enjoyable and interactive.
- **Flash cards**: Develops flashcard functionality to aid in memorization and recall.
