# Screens Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the screens planned in the `plan/` directory into the actual project structure under `src/`. The implementation converts the WireText (.wt) files into functional Flet-based Python screens.

## Implemented Screens

### 1. Initial Screen (`src/presentation/screens/initial_screen.py`)
- **Based on**: `plan/initial-screen.wt`
- **Purpose**: Welcome screen shown when the application starts with no learning paths created
- **Features**:
  - Empty state with folder icon
  - "Start by creating a new path..." message
  - "Create New Path" button that triggers the create path dialog

### 2. About Dialog (`src/presentation/screens/about_dialog.py`)
- **Based on**: `plan/about.wt`
- **Purpose**: Shows application information and version details
- **Features**:
  - Application name and version (0.1.0)
  - Description of the application
  - GitHub repository link
  - Modal dialog with OK button

### 3. Create Path Dialog (`src/presentation/screens/create_path_dialog.py`)
- **Based on**: `plan/creating-path.wt`
- **Purpose**: Dialog for creating new learning paths
- **Features**:
  - Multi-line text field for subject input
  - Pre-filled with "Japanese JLPT1" example
  - Create and Cancel buttons
  - Input validation with error messages
  - Success notification upon creation

## Architecture Components

### Base Screen (`src/presentation/screens/base_screen.py`)
- Abstract base class for all screens
- Provides common interface and lifecycle methods
- Ensures consistent screen behavior

### Screen Manager (`src/presentation/screens/screen_manager.py`)
- Centralized screen navigation and state management
- Handles screen transitions and dialog display
- Integrates with the main page for easy access to dialogs

## Updated Main Application

### Modified `src/presentation/win/main.py`
- **Menu System**: Updated to match the planned menu structure:
  - **Paths Menu**: Create, Load, Exit
  - **Configuration Menu**: LLM Providers
  - **Help Menu**: About
- **Layout**: Restructured to use the new screen system
- **Integration**: Connected menu actions to appropriate screens/dialogs

## Menu Structure (as planned in `plan/common.wt`)
```
MenuBar
├── Paths
│   ├── Create (opens Create Path Dialog)
│   ├── Load (placeholder)
│   └── Exit (closes application)
├── Configuration
│   └── LLM Providers (placeholder)
└── Help
    └── About (opens About Dialog)
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Responsive UI**: All screens adapt to different window sizes
2. **Modal Dialogs**: About and Create Path dialogs are properly modal
3. **Error Handling**: Input validation in Create Path dialog
4. **User Feedback**: Success/error messages using SnackBar
5. **Consistent Styling**: Follows Flet design patterns and Material Design
6. **Navigation**: Seamless transitions between screens and dialogs

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flet (Python UI framework)
- **Architecture**: Screen-based with centralized management
- **Styling**: Material Design components with custom styling
- **State Management**: Handled through Screen Manager
- **Dependency Injection**: Integrated with existing DI container

## Testing

- All screen imports verified successfully
- Application starts without errors
- Menu navigation functional
- Dialog system operational
- SnackBar notifications working correctly

## Bug Fixes

### SnackBar Implementation
- **Issue**: Initial implementation used `page.show_snack_bar()` which doesn't exist in Flet
- **Fix**: Updated to use `page.snack_bar` property with `page.snack_bar.open = True` and `page.update()`
- **Files affected**: `src/presentation/screens/create_path_dialog.py`

## Future Enhancements

The implemented screens provide a solid foundation for:
- Adding more learning path management features
- Implementing LLM provider configuration
- Adding file load/save functionality
- Expanding the help system
- Adding more interactive learning features

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/presentation/screens/__init__.py`
- `src/presentation/screens/base_screen.py`
- `src/presentation/screens/initial_screen.py`
- `src/presentation/screens/about_dialog.py`
- `src/presentation/screens/create_path_dialog.py`
- `src/presentation/screens/screen_manager.py`

### Modified Files:
- `src/presentation/win/main.py` (major refactoring)
- `src/core/app.py` (removed unnecessary @inject decorator)

The implementation successfully translates the WireText plans into a functional, modern UI that maintains the intended user experience while leveraging Flet's capabilities for cross-platform desktop applications.
